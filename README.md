# Dungeon generation using BSP trees

Essentially, a binary space partition algorithm will recursively divide a surface into two for a number of iterations. A binary tree provides the most obvious data structure to traverse the different levels of partitions.

For partitioning, in each iteration the direction of the division -horizontal or vertical- is assigned randomly and so is the size of the first partition, while the second just takes the remaining of the space. Later, on the leafs of the tree (down-most nodes), rooms can be grown within the container, be it randomly or by assigning some constraints that suit the generation. Finally, by connecting the center of each one of the partitions with his brother, all the partitions get connected and accessible.
